I've recently learnt about typescript decorators and would like to share and also show how you can create loggers easily with decorators

<!--more-->
At the moment of writing Typescript Decorators are in experimental mode, so as it says on official [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html){:target="_blank"} site

| NOTEâ€ƒ Decorator metadata is an experimental feature and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.

Remember that decorators are run when the class is created for the first time, **not when instance is created**

Ok,

1. In order to enable decorators please uncomment in `tsconfig.json`:
```JSON
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "experimentalDecorators": true, /* Enables experimental support for ES7 decorators. */,
      "emitDecoratorMetadata": true /* Enables experimental support for emitting type metadata for decorators. */
    }
}
```

2. Now logging:

```javascript
class Car {
    @logError('oops it\'s broken') // applying decorator
    drive(): void {
        // throwing error to see how decorator logs into console
        throw Error
        console.log('go go go')
    }
}
// wrapping decorator into function to accept
// arguments(in this case - string)
function logError(message: string) {
    // it needs to return decorator function
    return function(target: any, key: string, desc: PropertyDescriptor) {
        const method = desc.value;
        desc.value = () => {
            try {
                method()
            } catch (e) {
                console.log(message)
            }
        }
    }
}

new Car().drive()
```

first argument is prototype of the object, in our case it'll be `Car`

second the key of the property/method on the object, in this case it'll be `drive`

third - property descriptor

|-----|----|-----|
| writable | whether this property can be changed |
| enumerable |whether this propery can be looped with for..in |
| value | current value |
| configurable | whether property definition can be changed and property definition can be deleted |

Look at this example of descriptors:

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; padding: 20px 0;">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/obj_descriptors.png"/>
</div>

Now let's take a closer look to:

```javascript
const method = desc.value;
desc.value = () => {
    try {
        method()
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(message)
    }
}
```

`desc.value` will hold the value(body) of the method. so we can call it later in `try` block. After that we reassign body(value) of this method by
`desc.value = () => {}`


So, basically, everytime we call the method, in case if it fails we will have our custom logging applied. Nice!

Thanks for reading!
