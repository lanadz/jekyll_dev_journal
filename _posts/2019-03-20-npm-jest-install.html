    Hi,
  </p>

  <p>
    I've started going through some exercises for JS (getting ready for
    interviews heheh)
  </p>

  <p>
    And there they asked to have <strong>`jest`</strong> installed on my
    computer to run tests from those challenges
    <!--more-->
    <br />
    Oh, yes,
    <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html">jest</a> looks very
    promising test framework to me. Finally my TDD skills from Ruby world can be
    applied to JS ðŸ˜„
  </p>

  <p>
    After following installation guide and trying to run tests, I was receiving
    error <strong>`$ command not found: jest`</strong>
    <br />
    Solution was to add `sudo` before command (which wasn't mentioned in guide
    ðŸ˜ž)
  </p>

  <p>
    {% highlight bash %} sudo npm install -g jest {% endhighlight %}
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks
  </p>
