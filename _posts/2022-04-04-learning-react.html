    What I was doing recently? I must say a lot.
    I reviewed my JavaScript knowledge, looked into new things of ES6, TypeScript, React, etc.

    I am changing my mind about React. As I mentioned before I used Vue for <a href="https://educards.owldot.com"
      target="_blank">EduCards</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    2 years ago when I had little idea of modern JavaScript and it's frameworks, React looked hard to me and writing
    SPA with it was close to impossible (mind I had no one to talk about principles and best(or even any) practices).
    Vue looked easier, more opinionated if you will. <br />
    They had their official router, state manager and great documentation. And with the help of tutorial and
    couple online courses EduCards was ready for production in less than 2 months.
  </p>
  <p>
    This time I decided to look into React again, and you know it's not that difficult as it used to be 2 years ago.
    As I was said, I need to learn one framework and another one will be easier to pick up.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an exercise, I am planning to rewrite my Vue project to React and see how it goes. Of course, I will share my
    progress here ðŸ˜Š

    And here is my <a href="https://github.com/lanadz/react-tutorial" target="_blank">Tic-Tac-Toe game</a>, which is
    basically following original

    Thanks!<br />
    Believe in yourself!
