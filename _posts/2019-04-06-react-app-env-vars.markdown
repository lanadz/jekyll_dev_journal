...I added variable to `.env.development` like this `API_URL=http://localhost:3000/`

...I restarted server

...I googled for an hour

...And I still was facing that `process.env.API_URL` is `undefined`

Somehow I missed this from official [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)

| Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT_APP_. Any other variables except NODE_ENV will be ignored to avoid accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name. Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.

That's smart, but ðŸ¤¬

Anyways, don't forget to add `REACT_APP_` prefix to your variables

Happy coding!
