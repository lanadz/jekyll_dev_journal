Hi,

As I am preparing to get a job as a Front End Developer I am learning a lot of JS recently.
It's nothing like it was 5+ years ago, haha.
Yeah, so you probably know that egghead is an awesome resource and [learn es6](https://egghead.io/courses/learn-es6-ecmascript-2015) is awesome in particular. Short chunks of valuable information.
