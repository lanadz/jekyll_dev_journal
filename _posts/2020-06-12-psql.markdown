Here is compiled a list of commands to run in postgres console:

## Run console

`$ docker-compose exec db psql -Upostgres` to run pg console. In my case, I am running it from docker and the user is postgres, no password.

## List databases

`$ \l` Will list available databases

## Switch database

`$ \c DATABASE_NAME` allows you to switch between databases.

## Listing

`$ \d` when connected to the database, list tables, views, and sequences.

`$ \dt` list tables only.

`$ \d+ TABLE_NAME` show description of the table:

### Show columns name:

`$ \t` If queries show data but you don't see table's, this command will help to toggle that.
