Do you know about <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">The GitHub Arctic Code Vault</a>?

<blockquote>
The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. The archive is located in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, closer to the North Pole than the Arctic Circle. GitHub will capture a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserve that data in the Arctic Code Vault.

Because I didn't.

I noticed a new badge on my github [profile](https://github.com/lanadz) and was surprised to learn that this blog was stored in Arctic Code Vault. Something I leave for future generations ðŸ˜…. That made me happy!
