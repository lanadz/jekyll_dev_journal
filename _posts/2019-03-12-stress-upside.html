      >The Upside of Stress: Why Stress Is Good for You, and How to Get Good at
      It by Kelly McGonigal</a
    >
    I've heard about this book some time ago at
    <a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/bandersnatching-our-drinks/"
      >Front End Happy Hour</a
    >. Some of the guests recommended it.

    And when I saw it in the library I've just grabbed it. Honestly, I haven't
    finished it yet. But I can already tell that book helped me a lot. I am
    going through a lot of stress every day and mostly I can deal with that. But
    this thing that "Stress is bad for you. You will die soon, you will get ill
    etc." buzzing somewhere unconsciously. üòÖ

    I am not going to take your time and retell you the book just go and check
    it yourself.
