Useful flags for `git`:

- `git log --graph` shows logs in graph presentation
- `git pull --ff-only` Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the current HEAD is already up to date or the merge can be resolved as a **fast-forward**.
- `git pull --rebase` rebase the current branch on top of the upstream branch after fetching
- `git show --output=<file>` prints diff to file. Pretty useful sometimes
- `git show <sha> --name-only` prints not all changes but file names only
- `git difftool` [link](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool) that's interesting tool to compare files visually
