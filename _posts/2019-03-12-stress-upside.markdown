Hi,

[The Upside of Stress: Why Stress Is Good for You, and How to Get Good at It by Kelly McGonigal](https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Stress-Why-Good-You-ebook/dp/B00OI5PGWU)

I've heard about this book some time ago at [Front End Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/bandersnatching-our-drinks/). Some of the guests recommended it.

And when I saw it in the library I've just grabbed it.
Honestly, I haven't finished it yet. But I can already tell that book helped me a lot.
I am going through a lot of stress every day and mostly I can deal with that. But this thing that "Stress is bad for you. You will die soon, you will get ill etc." buzzing somewhere unconsciously.

I am not going to take your time and retell you the book just go and check it yourself.

P.S It also available in audio format üëçüéß

*Embrace your stress and it'll enhance you*
