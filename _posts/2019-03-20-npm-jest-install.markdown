Hi,

I started going through some exercises for JS (getting ready for interviews heheh)

And there they asked to have `jest` installed on my computer to run tests from those challenges

Oh, yes, [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html) looks very promising test framework to me. Finally my TDD skills from Ruby world can be applied to JS ðŸ˜„   

After following installation guide and trying to run tests, I was receiving error `$ command not found: jest` 
Solution was to add `sudo` before command (which wasn't mentioned in guide ðŸ˜ž)
{% highlight bash %}
sudo npm install -g jest
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks
