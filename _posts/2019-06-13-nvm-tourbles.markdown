| nvm is not compatible with the npm config "prefix" option: currently set to "/usr/local/Cellar/nvm/0.34.0/versions/node/v10.16.0"
Run `npm config delete prefix` or `nvm use --delete-prefix v10.16.0 --silent` to unset it.

Looks familiar?

Ok, I need to be able to change `node` versions for different projects. `npm` is handy tool for such cases.

| * I don't have `node` installed globally<br/> * `nvm` version 0.34 installed via `brew`</li>

Problem was that my fresh opened console didn't know command `node`, so
I had to run `nvm use xxx`,
then it complained on `config prefix option`,
then running `npm config delete prefix` didn't give any result because `env: node: No such file or directory`,
so I needed to run `nvm use --delete-prefix v10.16.0` which is solution for open tab of terminal only.
And I was supposed to repeat that everytime I open new window in terminal.

### Solution

How I fixed that:
- run `nvm use --delete-prefix v10.16.0` to be able to start `node`
- run `node` to ensure that it's working
- run `npm config delete prefix` to ensure that it's deleted
- run to set it back `npm config set prefix $NVM_DIR/versions/node/v10.16.0`

So, basically I needed to reset nvm prefix.

I hope it will help you too ðŸ¤“

Cheers!
