So, let's say you need to add new flag `--watch` to your script from `package.json` In this case to "test" script

```json
...
scripts: {
"test": "jest"
}
```

Yes, you can add `"test": "jest --watch"` to your `package.json`, but that might be not very convinient, insted you can add this directly in terminal.
But mind, that 

```bash
$ npm test --watch
```
won't work as expected because `--watch` will be considered as a part of npm command, not jest comman as we would like

So, what you should do instead is 


```
$ npm test -- --watch
```

First pair of `--` associates arguments with `npm` (in our case we don't need any) and second pair of `--` will associate with `test` command (which is in our case is `jest`)

Hope you find that helpful
