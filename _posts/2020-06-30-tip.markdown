It happens to me, that I can work and then I have an urge to google something or I reminded to do something.
And push it away doesn't work. I cannot keep focused because I absolutely need to check if <span style='text-decoration: line-through'>something is available on amazon, to track and order, check if plants are watered,</span> you name it.
And all those things can wait, but still, ðŸ˜… I want to do it know

What surprisingly worked well: "distracting list"!

I just created a note where I put all those minor things for later. Guess the trick is that it is written and saved and I don't need to "keep that in memory"
